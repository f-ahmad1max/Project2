<b>STATION ALERT: 82ND STREET STATION
VIVA LA COMIDA FESTIVAL</b><br>
Friends, we are gearing up for our LAST community beautification project!
We are collaborating with 82nd Street Partnership in Jackson Heights, Queens on their annual 'Viva La Comida' Festival (www.vivalacomida.com).
The street festival (located at 82nd Street and Roosevelt Ave.) takes place Saturday September 17, 2016 from 12-7PM and showcases the neighborhood's cultural diversity (music, food, entertainment).  We are using this opportunity to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month through the LIVE painting of 10 free-standing canvases.   Colorful patterns will be inspired by some the of the rich, colorful woven textiles found in Hispanic Culture and Heritage.
St. John University's Alpha Phi Omega Service Fraternity has agreed to partner with us in creating these works!
At the end of the day, canvases will be distributed to local neighborhood organizations for free, allowing our celebration to live indoors year-round.
Our mural efforts are supported through a grant from the Citizens Committee of New York City.

7TRAIN MURALS 'COLOR-A-KEG' CONTEST</b><br>
7Train Murals was selected as Big Alice Brewing's Libations & Donations recipient for July 2016!  
Big Alice kindly dedicated a happy hour to us where we received 10% of the register and 100% of the tips.
So we celebrated our 3rd Year Anniversary that evening AND collaborated on a 'Color-A-Keg' coloring contest!
Two winners, Sarah Miller and Alison Allende won with their keg designs.
Each winner and 3 of their lucky friends won a happy hour, a cool prize from Bing's Hallmark in Sunnyside, and the opportunity to paint an actual keg with their design!
It all went down August 21+ 23 and you can see their artistry for yourself now in Big Alice's Tasting Room, located in Long Island City!</b>
